IUSD: Bennett-Kew: Step 01: Daily Report Archive - Memory File

Purpose & context
Adam is a Construction Manager at Fonder-Salari Inc (FSI) overseeing the Bennett-Kew P-8 Academy Site Improvements project for Inglewood USD under contract B-2529. His primary objective is maintaining systematic project documentation through daily construction reports and generating comprehensive weekly summaries that serve both executive reporting and quality assurance purposes. The project involves foundation work, underground utilities, concrete operations (SOG - Slab on Grade), and site improvements while ensuring zero educational disruptions to the active school site.
Key project personnel include Akmal Hanna (Inspector of Record), Kian Abghari (PM), Akram Boles (Superintendent), and Ken Wong (structural engineer). Major subcontractors include Quality Rebar, Rancho Electric, Continual Plumbing, and Marina Landscape. The work requires coordination with geotech oversight, SWPMP compliance, and various testing protocols including compaction testing and structural inspections.
Adam has developed a sophisticated two-project Claude system: the Bennett-Kew Daily Report Archive for data extraction and weekly summary generation, and a separate Report Generation Project for final formatting. He's also configured Desktop Commander MCP integration to read PDFs directly from his local OneDrive folder, creating a "Live Folder Link" solution that eliminates the need to upload all reports to project knowledge.
Current state
The project has progressed from foundation and utility work to concrete operations, currently showing advancement from 28% to 32% completion as of early February 2026. Recent activities focus on SOG concrete pours across different grid sections (A-G/11-15 and A-G/3-11), with crews ranging from 7-16 PCN3 workers and involvement of concrete deputy inspectors for major pours.
Adam maintains an extensive archive of daily reports spanning from September 2025 through February 2026, with systematic weekly summary generation occurring every Friday. The reporting workflow has been refined to handle token limits through sequential daily searches rather than broad date range queries. Weather continues to be a significant factor, with rain delays requiring dewatering operations and site protection protocols.
Key learnings & principles
Critical technical constraints have been identified for the automated workflow: PDFs must be processed individually to avoid token limits, specific search patterns work reliably ("daily report [Month] [Day] [Year]" format), while others cause failures. The system requires precise date calculations and calendar accuracy, as demonstrated when Adam provided strong corrective feedback about date miscalculations.
Weather impact management has become a core competency, with established protocols for rain days including dewatering operations, BMP maintenance, plastic sheeting for site protection, and understanding that approximately five consecutive dry days are needed to complete footing work. The project has successfully maintained zero educational disruptions despite weather challenges and construction activities.
The two-output system has proven effective: KEY ACTIVITIES (5-7 bullet points in weekly narrative format) transfer to the Report Generation Project, while DAY-BY-DAY DETAIL remains in the archive for QAQC purposes. This separation allows for both executive-level reporting and detailed quality control documentation.
Approach & patterns
Adam follows a systematic weekly reporting cycle, typically requesting reports on Fridays for the Monday-Friday work week. The workflow involves sequential daily report searches to compile comprehensive weekly summaries including progress estimates, key activities, weather impacts, testing results, and next week projections.
The established search protocol requires one-day-at-a-time queries to avoid token limits, using specific date formatting rather than broad searches. When daily reports are missing from the archive (common for same-day or recent dates), Adam provides verbal summaries to maintain reporting continuity.
Decision-making emphasizes precision and accuracy, particularly around calendar calculations and progress tracking. Adam demonstrates strong familiarity with construction terminology and expects reports to capture both high-level progress and granular operational details including personnel counts, equipment usage, subcontractor activities, and inspection results.
Tools & resources
The primary system utilizes Claude's project knowledge search with specific query patterns that have been tested and refined. Desktop Commander MCP provides local file system access through a configuration-driven approach, allowing unlimited access to local files without consuming project knowledge storage.
The Bennett-Kew Daily Report Archive contains an extensive collection of daily construction reports following consistent naming conventions. The system includes comprehensive project instructions and quick-start documentation for generating weekly summaries while avoiding technical limitations.
Weather data integration includes web search capabilities for specific timing information (such as when rain stopped in Inglewood, California) to provide accurate context for construction activities and delays.
