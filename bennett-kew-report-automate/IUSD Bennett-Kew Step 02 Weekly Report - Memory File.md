Purpose & context
Adam is a Senior Project Manager at Fonder-Salari Inc., serving as Construction Manager for the Bennett-Kew P-8 Academy new classroom building project in Inglewood, CA. The project involves constructing a single-story building with 6 classrooms, restrooms, utility spaces, and a multipurpose area, plus site work including play fields and solar installation for Inglewood Unified School District. This is an active school campus construction project with a critical August 9, 2026 substantial completion deadline—only one day buffer before school starts.
Key stakeholders include Principal Sarah Appleton, PCN3 Inc. (General Contractor), HED Design (Architect), and various subcontractors. The project operates under a zero educational disruptions mandate, with special considerations for Room 19 SPED programming and students with sensory sensitivities. Adam manages communication across technical and educational audiences, adapting from detailed construction reports to simplified stakeholder emails. The 365-day contract spans from September 2025 through August 2026, with built-in weather contingencies and strict coordination requirements around school operations and testing schedules.
Current state
Adam has developed a sophisticated two-project automation system in Claude.ai for generating weekly construction reports, which has been in production use for 21+ weeks. The system processes Procore daily reports into comprehensive weekly progress reports, principal emails, and meeting agendas. The project is currently in the foundation/SOG preparation phase, with recent concrete pouring milestones achieved and ongoing site preparation work.
The automation workflow has evolved from problematic day-by-day formats to refined narrative weekly summaries, with specific formatting rules developed through iterative refinement. Adam is actively transferring this system from Claude.ai to Claude Code to overcome token limitations, requiring comprehensive documentation of the complete system architecture, SOPs, and failure modes.
On the horizon
Adam is implementing the Claude Code migration to improve system portability and efficiency, moving from a 180-240 second report generation process down to 30-60 seconds. He's also exploring automated PDF report generation capabilities using HTML-to-PDF approaches for professional construction documentation that can be adapted across multiple construction projects.
Upcoming construction phases include continued SOG operations, underground utilities installation, and coordination of sound mitigation measures including remaining sound wall materials currently on backorder. The project timeline requires careful coordination around school testing schedules and academic calendar constraints.
Key learnings & principles
Adam has established that 3-week look-ahead schedules are projections with lesser truth value than daily reports and should only be used for interpolation when daily data is missing. Weekly reports must always include a Critical Items section after Milestones Achieved, using "None" if no issues exist, and should be broken into separate code blocks per section for individual copy buttons in artifact view.
Construction reporting requires ultra-concise communication with extensive use of industry abbreviations (bldg, w/, ops, geotech, UG, SWPMP, SPED, over-ex). Narrative weekly summaries work better than day-by-day breakdowns, with maximum two lines per bullet point using asterisk bullets only. Communication must be adapted significantly between technical reports (detailed, industry-specific) and stakeholder emails (conversational, accessible, relationship-focused).
Approach & patterns
Adam's communication style is ultra-concise and construction-focused, preferring executive-level bullets over verbose narratives with no unnecessary back-and-forth or permission-seeking. He emphasizes proactive transparency with school administrators, addressing concerns directly while providing context and solutions. Reports follow strict formatting with specific bullet styles, mandatory abbreviations, precise countdown calculations, and professional construction industry terminology.
The workflow involves weekly uploads of four key documents: daily reports from Procore, meeting minutes, 3-week look-ahead schedules, and baseline schedules. Adam maintains different communication approaches for different audiences—technical detailed reports for internal review, simplified plain-language emails for school principals, and brief coordination emails for colleagues. Quality control processes include colleague review before distribution and careful attention to accuracy in reflecting actual site conditions.
Tools & resources
Adam works primarily with Procore for daily construction reporting, Claude.ai projects for report automation, and standard construction management tools. The system processes PDF daily reports (often ZIP-packaged files requiring special handling), meeting transcripts, and scheduling documents. Key project documents include baseline schedules, 3-week look-ahead calendars, and comprehensive SOPs developed over months of iterative refinement.
The automation system requires specific search strategies to avoid token limits—searching one day at a time with exact dates rather than broad queries. File viewing tools are essential for ZIP-packaged Procore reports where standard PDF extraction methods fail. The system maintains static template sections that must be copied verbatim rather than regenerated, including project descriptions and community promise sections refined through extensive use.
