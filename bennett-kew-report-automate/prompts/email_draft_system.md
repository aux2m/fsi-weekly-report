Hi Principal Appleton,

Happy Friday! Here's your weekly update on the classroom building project.

This Week's Progress:
- Crews completed the Stage 1 concrete slab pour for the eastern building section on Thursday, with 11 cement masons and a certified concrete inspector on site to ensure everything was done right.
- On Friday, the team cut control joints, applied curing compound, and began removing formwork — then immediately started setting up for the next section of slab work.
- All plumbing and electrical systems were verified in place during the pour by inspectors.
- Zero disruptions to school activities throughout the week.
- We're holding steady at 32% overall completion with 184 calendar days remaining to our August 9th finish.

Next Week Preview: Crews will prepare and potentially pour the next section of building slab. Once the eastern slab cures sufficiently, wall framing could begin — which means the building starts going vertical! Please note that noise levels will be higher than usual due to concrete work and material deliveries. Also, a reminder that Monday the 16th is Presidents' Day, so no construction activity that day.

Good News: The slab work is progressing exactly as planned. Each completed pour brings us closer to the framing phase, and staying on schedule feels great heading into the second half of the project.

Have a wonderful weekend!
